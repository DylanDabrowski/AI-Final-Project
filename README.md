# AI-Final-Project

Abstract: 
The project I worked on was the Abalone dataset, specifically the rings that identify their age. For scientists studying Abalone this dataset is very valuable and holds a lot of data on a large population of Abalone. In this project I learned that some of the top factors affecting the Rings (age) of the Abalone can be their height, shucked weight, and diameter.
